# Kel

Kel is a ridculously simple markdown static site generation system. It is super easy to setup, simple as anything and as flexible as you can make it.

**Latest Version:** 0.2.0

## Features

- **Easy setup:** Install Kel through npm, edit some files and generate your site
- **Simple Editing:** Every markdown file under the `/pages` folders is a page and every file under the `/posts` folder is a blog post. Create or edit the markdown file and you're done.
- **Flexible Theming:** Write your own themes and styles and let Kel do the work.

## Quick Start Guide

1. [Download](http://nodejs.org/#download) and install the latest version of Node.js. It's super simple!
2. Install Kel by running `npm install kel`. If you can run `kel -v` without any problems, you've got it installed. 
3. Start a site by running `kel <site name>`, where site name is your new website name.
4. Edit the markdown files and theme files that are created and `kel generate` creates the static files immediately.
